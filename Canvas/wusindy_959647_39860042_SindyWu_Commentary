COMMENTARY

Computational Complexity:
insertEnd - O(n)
insertN - O(n)
deleteN - O(n)
editN - O(n)
search - O(n)
print - O(n)

Linked List Advantages/Disadvantages:
I think using a linked list for a line editor is a good choice. The advantages are there is no cap on size or need to readjust size and insertion and deletion is much easier since there is no need to readjust the rest of the lines such as if an array was used. However, because of the linked list implementation, it isn't possible to instantly access and edit any line. Also, since we're mainly inserting at the end, a single linked list with an iterator or a doubly linked list would make it more advantageous since there would be instant access for insertEnd.


Project 1 Reflection:
I learned how to parse a string and that I needed to always check if a node is null. I also relearned how to use pointers and the structure of a linked list. If I had to start over, I would plan how I would code it instead of just diving in. Also, I would implement an iterator so that the computational complexity of my insertion and deletion methods would be O(1) instead of O(n).
